#Task 5.1: Lists Write a program that: Creates a list of 5 numbers. Adds a new number to the list. Removes the second number from the list. Prints the sum of all numbers in the list.
data = [12,45,33,66,21]
data.append(59)
data.remove(12)
print(data)
total = sum(data[0:len(data)])
print(total)

#Task 5.2: Tuples Write a program that: Creates a tuple with the names of 5 cities. Prints the third city in the tuple. Converts the tuple into a list, adds a new city, and converts it back to a tuple. Prints the modified tuple.
locations = ( 'Dhaka', 'New Delhi', 'Cairo' , 'Tokyo', 'Shanghai' )
print(locations[2])
loc = list(locations)
loc.append('New York')
loc.remove('Cairo')
locations = tuple(loc)
print(locations)

#Task 5.3: Dictionaries Write a program that: Creates a dictionary where keys are subject names (e.g., Math, Science) and values are the marks (e.g., 90, 85). Adds a new subject with its mark to the dictionary. Updates the mark for one subject. Prints the average marks.
# Step 1: Create the initial dictionary with subjects and marks
marks = {
    "Math": 90,
    "Science": 85,
    "English": 88
}
marks["History"] = 92
marks["Science"] = 89

total_marks = sum(marks.values())
average_marks = total_marks / len(marks)

# Displaying the results
print("Subject Marks:")
for subject, mark in marks.items():
    print(f"{subject}: {mark}")
    
print(f"Average Marks: {average_marks:.2f}")
